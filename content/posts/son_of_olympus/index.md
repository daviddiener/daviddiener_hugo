Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you about my epic masterpiece, Son of Olympus. It's a real-time strategy game based on Greek mythology, so of course there was some kind of inspiration from on of my favorite RTS games Age Of Mythology.

I owe a lot of the credit to the [RTS Engine](https://gamedevspice.com/assets/rts-engine/) asset, which saved me countless hours of coding. Instead, I was able to focus on the fun part â€“ designing the game and creating content.

Here are some pictures of what the game currently looks like:
