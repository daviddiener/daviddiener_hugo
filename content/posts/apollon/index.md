As a pianist and software developer, I always wanted to create a tool that would allow me to visualize the notes played on a piano in real-time. Inspired by the videos of [Patrik Pietschmann](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs7O9sOUQiBGBxaaAguIwig), I decided to develop Apollon, a piano midi visualizer tool using Unity.

Apollon is a powerful tool that allows users to import midi files and visualize them. The resulting video displays particles for each midi note played, creating a stunning visual display of the music. The particles use the Unity Physics system and can be adjusted in the application settings, giving users complete control over the visual effects.

Apollon is easy to use and can be downloaded from my itch.io page below. Once downloaded, users can import their midi files and begin rendering out the video.

The tool is the culmination of months of hard work and dedication, and I am thrilled to share it with other music enthusiasts and developers.

To see Apollon in action, check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dev.david.diener), where I have uploaded videos of my own visualizations using the tool.
