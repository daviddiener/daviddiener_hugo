Welcome to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/)! This event is designed by Eric Wastl, packed with daily coding challenges that put your problem-solving skills to the test.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles suitable for various skill sets and levels. These puzzles can be solved in any programming language of your choice, making it an ideal platform for enthusiasts learning new languages!

I'll be documenting my solutions using Rust. Each day, I'll try to get the next two stars and share my approach, code snippets, and explanations in detail. Feel free to follow along and explore the solutions on my [GitHub repository for Advent Of Code 2023](https://github.com/daviddiener/AdventOfCode2023). Dive in, explore the code, and feel free to suggest improvements or alternative approaches.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ„âœ¨
